# UEWebsocket
unreal engine 4 websocket plugin(support ssl) for both c++ and blueprint developer.

This plugin is for unreal engine 4 c++ and blueprint developers, you can easily use c++ or blueprint
 to connect to remote server and send receive messages.
 
Unreal network is great for FPS or moba and IO games, but there's some games, you need to process network by yourself,
this plugin is for these people, you don't need to write any c++ code, 
the plugin support blueprint api to make json string from message object, and can also decode json to message object.

There's two level in the demo project, one for test websocket connect and send receive,
The other level is test message Object serialize to json string, and from json string to message object.
I did not use struct, because change a value of a struct in blueprint is not convenient.
